This repository contains document artifacts for an inforamtion exchange for Geothermal Areas. The artifacts include an Excel Workbook that defines and documents the content model, and an XML schema that implements the model.

This exchange is for polygon features representing geothermal areas. 
These data will have general information about land ownership, temperature characterization, geologic setting and information source. The Geothermal Area template is designed to be used for data compilation from maps and field data. 
The content model presented here is intended to present key information necessary to query a geothermal areas service and to evaluate/investigate geothermal potential. 

Deployed services use the approved 0.5 version. A new version 0.7 has beeen approved by GDSDPWG, but has not been used for services yet. Some versioning of new services or a meshing of the 0.5 and 0.7 needs to be determined.  2013-03-07
